# ECSE 457 - Design Project 2
## Structure
Arduino Code is classified by purpose. For the Arduino IDE, the .ino files must
be kept in a folder of the same name (the containing sketch). This is already
reflected in the current structure. Each folder is self-contained and can be
downloaded and operated independently of others. Library files are provided. 
Their proper dependency will be tested by the final submission. 

Progress reports and other administrative documents are kept seperately from the
code. 

THe CanKing file is the set-up for immediate use of the J1939 protocol with the
Kvasser handle.
