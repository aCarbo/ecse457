\section*{Group Meetings with Advisor}
A preliminary group meeting was held on January 12th to establish the
strategy for this semester's work. \newline

A meeting was held with our immediate supervisor on January 13th. During the
meeting, short-term goals and the meeting schedule for the rest of the semester
was discussed. During the meeting, we also received feedback on our final 
deliveravbles from last semester. Following this meeting, follow-up meeting was
held to check our progress and verify the feasability of the new goals for 
this term.\newline

A last meeting was held with our supervisor on January 19th to demo the work
accomplished during the first work session. 

\section*{Project Readings}
The CAN J1939 specification document has been provided for us by the supervisor.

\section*{Recent Progress}
We continued our previous work on the CAN bus communication. An Arduino was set
up as a write node, and both an Arduino and a CAN handle connected to a laptop 
were set up as read nodes. Both two-node and 3 node systems were tested. 
Initial steps to read sensor data and transmit it over the CAN communication
channel were taken.\newline

We also added tools for collaborative report writing and source version control.

\section*{Future Plans}
For the following weeks, the plan is to further test configurations of the
communications links. We will henceforth adhere to the J1939 CAN protocol.
The configuration includes collision handling on a multiple write-node
network and priority message handling. Once the transmission of sensor data is
complete, the receiving Arduino node will have to respond by driving a circuit.
This circuit will be designed in conjunction with the supervisor. This response
will be used to close the feedback loop.

\section*{Group Work Report}
So far, the work has been adequately and fairly shared bewteen two team members,
Aditya and Alejandro. The third team member, Shayan Ahmad, has not been present
since the beginning of the term. We two are still awaiting an official notice
of his plans for the semester. The supervisor has been made aware of the
situation. At the moment of writing this report, he has not made any
contributions to the work.
