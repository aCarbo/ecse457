\section*{Group Meetings with Advisor}
A preliminary group meeting was held on January 12th to establish the
strategy for this semester's work. \newline

A meeting was held with our immediate supervisor on January 13th. During the
meeting, short-term goals and the meeting schedule for the rest of the semester
was discussed. During the meeting, we also received feedback on our final 
deliveravbles from last semester. Following this meeting, follow-up meeting was
held to check our progress and verify the feasability of the new goals for 
this term. 

\section*{Project Readings}
There were no project readings identified since the previous report.

\section*{Recent Progress}
We continued our previous work on the CAN bus communication between the Arduino
and a laptop. This communication work allows us to verify the integrity of the 
link on the Arduino side. So far, two Arduino units can communicate the 
contents of a limited-size, statically programmed buffer. More advanced 
sharing of data will be added as discussed in future plans.\newline

We also added tools for collaborative report writing and source control. These
tools will allow us to change the workflow to a more collaborative, end-goal 
based flow as opposed to last semester's parallel, independent flow. 

\section*{Future Plans}
For the following weeks, the plan is to establish the communication links for 
the entire system. After testing their integrity and usbaility, we will 
develop them to be able to pass meaningful messages with sensor data and 
possibly response commands. This is the beginning of a closed feedback loop.

\section*{Group Work Report}
So far, the work has been adequately and fairly shared bewteen two team members,
Aditya and Alejandro. The third team member, Shayan Ahmad, has not been present
since the beginning of the term. We two are still awaiting an official notice
of his plans for the semester. The supervisor has been made aware of the
situation. At the moment of writing this report, he has not made any
contributions to the work.
